### Course Description

This course introduces Python as a language and tool for collecting, preprocessing, and visualizing data for business analytics. 
Long a favorite language among data scientists and business analysts, Python is an essential skill with applications in business modeling, 
optimization, statistical analysis, deep learning, and big data analytics. Starting with a review of the fundamental programming concepts, 
the course builds mastery of Python language, libraries, and tools through short lectures and online tutorials. 
The course concludes with a final project designed to demonstrate mastery of the subject. 

__Special Note for Online Learning__: this course is organized in a _flipped classroom_ format. Lecture videos and tutorial instructions will be made available to you prior to each week's class meeting. We will utlize the on-ground/virtual class meeting time mainly for interactive activities, Q&As, and project meetings. It is __essential__ for you to go over the pre-released weekly materials prior to the class meetings, to make them more efficient.

## Course Deliverables
### Coding Assignments

+ **Coding assignments**: there are five (5) coding assignments in this course, which means one (1) assignment for each study unit. In each assignment, you are expected to complete one or more data munging/exploration task(s) using Python/NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib. Each part is 100 points. 

+ The last part of the coding assignment will be a miniature version of your final project.You should consider using the notebook provided for the part for your final project presentation/report. Zero point.

You are __encouraged to collaborate__ with your peers. However, you are also responsible for learning the key lessons of each assignment. So, if you need help, ask for it and pay attention to the answers. If you know how to help someone (without doing the work for them), then please help them out. For any coding assignment, there is an __optional__ checkpoint that you can submit your work for feedback. Please allow enough time for feedback, and note your checkpoint submissions will __not__ be graded.

### DataCamp Assignments
DataCamp is an online learning community covering Python, R, and SQL. In this course, you will receive __free of charge__ accesses to learning materials. You will need to complete these materials on your own time, each part of the assignment counts for 25 points in your final grade.


### Course Project
Students will self-select into teams of about 2-3 students and will work in their
own time outside of class to complete a Python “code portfolio” that they can show future employers
to demonstrate their proficiency. __OPTIONALLY__, Each portfolio should consist of one or more Jupyter notebooks
posted on __Github__, and should focus on analyzing a particular set of data to uncover business insights.
The analysis will not only be graded based on the use of Python, but also on the _logic_, _presentation_,
_rigor_, and _business relevance_. Students are encouraged to find their own datasets rather than using
those from in-class activities. There are __two__ deliverables for the final project:
+ _Proposal (5%)_: a Jupyter notebook describing the dataset, basic descriptive features of the
data, and a plan for more in-depth analysis. The notebook should clearly describe the purpose,
methodology, and anticipated result of the analysis to a non-technical business audience.
+ _Final deliverable (25%)_: the completed portfolio, composed of one or more Jupyter
notebooks. They should be written with a target audience of a manager in a relevant company 
and should be written with clear descriptions and explanations that are understandable to a
non-technical audience. You are also required to do a presentation on your project.

With the submission of the final deliverable, each individual will complete a survey describing his or
her own contribution to the project, as well as a breakdown of the percentage of total work performed
by each person in the team. The breakdown must add up to 100% and must include yourself. This
will be used to adjust individual grades if certain members contributed little. Detailed instructions and
grading rubric for each deliverable will be posted before they are due. 

### Participation and Professionalism
Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.

### In-class Labs
In some of the classes, you are required to complete hands-on mini labs in class, in which you will need to apply skills covered in 
respective classes. You will need to __submit__ the __completed__ notebook before the __following class__. These are required work and timely complete them will reflect in your __participation and professionalism__ grade.

## Attendance and Class Participation

Learning will become much more informative and interesting through lively discussions and exchanges of ideas/experiences during the class sessions. As such, it is best to learn if you can attend class meetings in person. Successful class attendances, participations, and discussions, imply:

<!--__Special Note for Fall 2020__: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attending class meetings in person is __OPTIONAL__. That means if you registered in person, you do not have to come to class unless you want to. If you plan to join in the in-person, on-campus experiences, then you will need to complete a COVID-19 test before returning to campus. Please review the "Return to Campus Procedures" under the FAQs at https://www.fairfield.edu/reopen for detailed information on requesting a test and downloading the LiveSafe app to complete a health monitoring check before any campus visit. Additional questions can be directed to covidhealth@fairfield.edu.-->

__Special Note for the Online Section__: the online section will be synchronous - please attend the class meetings via zoom. You are expected to follow the _flipped classroom_ model (described below). And if you need help for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work), contact Ms. Yue (for technical support of Colab/Slack) or myself for assistance.

__Flipped Classroom__: This course, including both the in-person and the online sections, will follow a _flipped classroom_ manner. Which means the lectures (e.g. in _recorded videos_) will be released to you __prior__ to every schedule class meeting. It is __mandatory__ for you to watch the class videos prior to the class meetings. The actual class meeting will be mainly for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work). In order for this model to work, it is crucial for you to come in __prepared__. Refer to the __preparations__ item for more details.

__Note Taking__: While you are watching the class lectures, make sure you take notes. A separate presentation file will be provided to you via _Google Classroom_ for you to take notes. In most of the lecture notebooks, there are some exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. We will use a _buddy system_ in which students form 2-3 people groups for comparing notes and codes. Be aware that some of the material discussed in class will NOT be covered in the textbook, but will often appear in the assignments/projects. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. Of course, I realize that in some cases unforeseeable emergencies arise. If you need to miss class for a legitimate, predictable reason, you must inform me and also take the initiative as early as possible to mitigate the effects of that absence. For example, you should establish a buddy system and ask another peer to take notes, handouts for you. You should find out what took place in the class prior to your next class attendance.

<!--Attend each and every class in a timely manner. -->

__Preparations__: To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing carefully all required tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). This is __mandatory__!

__Contributing in Class Discussions__: If you are in class and are well prepared, the next key step is to contribute ideas. While this may seem difficult at first, asking questions helps your classmates as well as you in clarifying concepts and overall understanding. Each of you will eventually be working in some organization where collaboration and discussions will be es-sential to problem solving in some business domain. Consider classroom discussion in the same spirit and participate! You should consider asking/answering questions in our Slack channel ``buan6505`` as the __main__ channel of class communication.

__Respect and Dignity__: It is also important for each of us as individuals to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (I like to call this R&D). Listen carefully to the questions and comments while keeping an open mind for ideas. It is okay to disagree with certain viewpoints, but present your arguments in a courteous manner. Negative body la-guage such as rolling your eyes, using phrases such as “that was a dumb idea”, or interrupting others to express disagreements runs counter to the spirit of positive learning environment and is not okay. At the end of the day, we would like to create a positive environment that is conducive to learning.

__Professionalism__: As budding professionals and business majors, conduct yourself in a professional manner just as you would with an employer or colleague. Refrain for unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late to class, coming in and out of class, taking a nap in class, making unprofessional comments to other students and the instructor, and sending unprofessional comments. Out of respect for fellow students, all mobile communication and entertainment devices need to be turned off and kept off during the class. Only software tools required for the class (e.g. JupyterHub) or note taking software (e.g., Evernote) the class time.

## Other Course Policies

__Computer and Lab__: You will have to bring in a laptop for every class in order to complete the in-class tutorials. It is your responsibility to make sure that your laptop is up-to-date so that it runs the system smoothly. You will need to have access to a Jupyter environment to complete the course work - fail to do so will lead to failing the course.

__Course Materials__: All the teaching materials, including assignments and exams, are the intellectual properties of Fairfield University – distributing such materials without written approval is strongly prohibited.

__Late Submissions__: Grades become official one week after assignments/exams have been returned by the instructor. Late submissions might be accepted with a 10% grade penalty. Oral excuses are not acceptable. No make-up opportunities would be given to final deliverables of projects.

__Class Communications and Feedbacks__: We will use __Slack__ for __all__ course communications. __DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO YOUR PROFESSORS. DM instead.__ You will receive an email invitation from ``Yue.Pu@fairfield.edu`` with instructions. You need to join the ``#data6505`` channel to communicate with me and the class. Normally, I would reply to your DM no longer than __12__ hours. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. 

<!--When sending an email to your instructor, please include in your email your section name or the time you are taking the class (i.e., using “BA505  + your name” in the subject line). Normally, I would reply to your email no longer than __24__ hours. I will not respond to emails sending from/to non-university emails. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. Special Note: Throughout this course, I will use my student email address (jtao@student.fairfield.edu) to share course files with you – however, __ALL__ course related communications should be referred to my main email (jtao@fairfield.edu).-->

__Academic Honesty__: Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself.

__Students with Disabilities__: Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights and privileges of its services, programs and activities, in an accessible setting. Fur-thermore, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, we provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students, to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities. 

__Online Office/Coaching Hours__: online office hours are available via [Zoom](), which runs in addition to the regular on ground office hours. If needed, additional coaching hours can be arranged.

<!--__Python Tutoring__: Given the circumstances that the professor is not available, we have Python tutors for on-ground and online tutoring services. Make sure to maintain contacts with your Python tutors.-->
